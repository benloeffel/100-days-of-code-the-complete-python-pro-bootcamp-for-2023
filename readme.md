# 100 Days of Code Challenge with "The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"

Welcome to my journey of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**. I've undertaken this challenge using the course **"The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"** to strengthen my Python skills and broaden my programming horizons.

## Repository Structure

- üìÖ **`Day_X`** folders: Each folder is named according to the day of the challenge, e.g., `Day_1`, `Day_2`, and so on. Each folder contains the exercises, projects, or any code written on that particular day.
- üìù **`Notes`**: You might find occasional markdown files with notes or summaries about the lessons learned on that day.

## How to Use This Repository

1. If you're also following the same course, this repo can serve as a reference or a source of inspiration.
2. To navigate through my journey, simply open the folder for the day you're interested in.
3. Feel free to clone, fork, or star the repository!

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Starting the Virtual Environment**:

   Navigate to the project's root directory and activate the virtual environment:

   - **Linux/Mac**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **Windows** (Command Prompt):

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Windows** (PowerShell):
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```

   Once activated, you should see `(venv)` or a similar indication in the terminal, showing that the virtual environment is active.

2. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**:

   To exit the virtual environment, simply type:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

````

3. **Running Python Files**:

   To run a specific Python file, navigate to its directory and execute it with the Python command. For example, to run the `main.py` file inside the `Day_1_Printing` folder:

   ```bash
   python Day_1_Printing/main.py
   ```

## Goals of this Challenge

- ‚úÖ Commit to coding every day for 100 days.
- üîÑ Build a habit of coding and problem-solving.
- üìö Master the ins and outs of Python using the "The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course.
- üõ†Ô∏è Complete all projects and exercises provided in the course.
